Post-analysis:

Post-analysis contains scripts that were used to analyse the data after the significantly changing proteins and peptides were already identified.

- [Missing_analysis_figures.R](https://github.com/MoniPepelnjak/Thermal_unfolding/blob/master/Post-analysis/Missing_analysis_figures.R) script contains the remaining analysis for the figures 2 and 3 of the paper. Besides the plotting functions, the following analysis is found:
  - Randomised correlation analysis between individual proteins and the mean LiP stabilisation score
  - Calculation of the "best stabilisers" and number of stabilising conditions
  - Overlap calculation for figure 3A

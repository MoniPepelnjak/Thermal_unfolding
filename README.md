# Thermal unfolding - Human proteome

This repository contains a collection of scripts for analysis of LiP-MS thermal denaturation data used in the Osmolyte paper and can be used to analyse thermal stabilisation by any kind of small molecule

The scripts in the repository are organised in the following way:
- [General pipeline](General_pipeline) includes the script needed to identify significantly stabilised peptides and proteins from Spectronaut exprot file. 
- [Post-analysis](Post-analysis) is a collection of scripts used to further analyse the data and produce the figures of the paper. 
- [Validations](Validations) includes the scripts that were used to analyse the validation experiments of the project, such as CD, DSF and precipitation assay.
